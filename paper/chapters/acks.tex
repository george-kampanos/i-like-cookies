Thank you to my studies and project supervisor, Dr Sia Shahandashti, for providing guidance and feedback throughout the year and especially during this project.

Thank you also to my girlfriend Anthi, for putting up with my complaining and supporting me throughout my studies. You have been amazing and without you, this wouldn't have happened.
