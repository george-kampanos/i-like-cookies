# "Accept All": The Landscape of Cookie Banners in Greece & the UK
Hello, there! Welcome to the Github page of my [MSc Cyber Security](https://www.york.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-taught/courses/msc-cyber-security/) project. This is a study about Cookie Banners, and the privacy options that they provide, in Greece and the UK. By extending [OpenWPM](https://github.com/mozilla/OpenWPM), we were able to scrape over 14k websites and collect 8k Cookie Banners.

## Tools & Methods
In order to crawl that many websites and collect their Cookie Notices, this project developed a set of novel methods and extended existing ones. For instance, in order to identify the most pupolar websites in Greece and the UK, a number of different tools were built to parse the [Tranco](https://tranco-list.eu) and verify that the extracted websites allow crawling by checking their robots.txt and Terms of Service pages. 

Moreover, OpenWPM, a popular web privacy measurement framework, was extended so that it identifies Cookie Banners with the aid of the ["I don't care about cookies list"](https://www.i-dont-care-about-cookies.eu).

You can find all the code and how to run it under the [`code`](https://github.com/george-kampanos/i-like-cookies/tree/master/code) directory of this Git page. Why not give it a go in websites of your country? :)
